    <h5>Objective:</h5>
      Developed a website for Mzamomtsha Primary School to showcase its local and national presence. 
      The school, originally serving grades 1 to 7, 
      now accommodates students up to grade 12 due to rapid population growth. 
      Challenges include inadequate classrooms, no prior online presence, 
      and staffing issues with 700 students and 20 teachers. 
      The website aims to address these challenges and highlight the school's accomplishments.
